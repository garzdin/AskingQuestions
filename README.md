# AskingQuestions

A simple Java application for asking questions. You can define the questions in a function with a pre-defined answer and the user inputs his answer in the console

You can ask questions like so:
IntegerQuestion question = new IntegerQuestion("What's 100 multiplied by 2", 200);
question.AskQuestion();
